<h3>Julio Bacmeister</h3>
<p><em>iHESP Scientist</em></p>
<p>Dr. Bacmeister received his Ph. D. in 1987 and has worked in a number of areas related to atmospheric modeling and parameterization. His research interests include global modeling of the atmosphere at "high" resolution. High resolution in the context of global models currently means horizontal grid spacing on the order of tens of kilometers. In this resolution range global models begin to simulate some important mesoscale features, such as tropical cyclones, but most convective motion in the atmosphere is still poorly resolved. Unfortunately, parameterizations of deep convection developed for climate models at much coarser resolution also perform poorly in this setting, often interfering with incipient mesoscale "organization". He is trying to understand the interactions between parameterized and resolved dynamics in these simulations, and to help develop better methods for representing deep convection in global models.</p>

<h3>Frederic Castruccio</h3>
<p><em>iHESP Scientist</em></p>
<p>Dr. Castruccio is a member of the Oceanography Section of the Climate &amp; Global Dynamics (CGD) Laboratory at NCAR. He received his Masters in Marine Sciences from the Mediterranean University (Marseille, France), and a Ph.D. in Physical Oceanography from the Joseph Fourier University (Grenoble, France). Since joining NCAR, his research has focused on the modelling and analysis of ocean dynamics and its key contributions to climate variability. He uses a combination of numerical models, observation and data assimilation to create realistic simulations of the global and regional ocean circulation, that are relevant to describe the ocean and sea-ice variability and to study the dynamical processes that generate variability in the ocean over a wide range of spatial and temporal scales. He also works with marine biologists to study how does the changes in ocean dynamics and thermodynamics affect marine ecosystems. His current work focuses on the role of the ocean in decadal variability and the importance of decadal variability in improving decadal climate predictions.</p>

He obtained his PhD in Meteorology and Physical Oceanography in May 2018. His dissertation combined drifter and satellite observations to investigate the air-sea exchange of mechanical energy, focusing on the role of air-sea coupling mechanisms operating over the ocean mesoscales in mediating the energy fluxes. His postdoctoral research expands on the results of his dissertation by using observations and climate model simulations to explore how ocean phenomena can drive the air-sea coupling characteristics revealed by satellite data, and the feedbacks arising from this interaction to variability in both mediums.</p>
